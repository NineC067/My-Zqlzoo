--#1. For each continent show the number of countries:

SELECT continent, COUNT(name)
  FROM world
 GROUP BY continent
 
 --#2. For each continent show the total population:
 
 SELECT continent, SUM(population)
  FROM world
 GROUP BY continent
 
 --#3. WHERE and GROUP BY. The WHERE filter takes place before the aggregating function. 
 For each relevant continent show the number of countries that has a population of at least 200000000:
 
 select continent, count(name)
 from world
 where population>=2e8
 group by continent
 
 --#4. GROUP BY and HAVING. The HAVING clause is tested after the GROUP BY. You can test the aggregated values with a HAVING clause. 
 Show the total population of those continents with a total population of at least half a billion:
 
 *** if we write the following code results would show Asia, and the sum of population (not the population sum = 4630057826 of countries in asia,
 but sum of population for all the countries =7615648652. 
 why is it showing asia not other continent names?
 
 Select continent, sum(population)
 from world 

 ***
 SELECT continent, SUM(population)
  FROM world
 GROUP BY continent
HAVING SUM(population)>=0.5e9
